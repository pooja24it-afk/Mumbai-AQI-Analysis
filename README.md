Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis of Mumbai Using Python

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Mumbai using Python.
The main objective is to study air pollution patterns using data preprocessing, basic statistical techniques, and visual analysis.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle
City: Mumbai
File Format: CSV
The dataset contains AQI values and pollutant-related information such as PM2.5.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Google Colab

Techniques Performed
Data loading and inspection
Handling missing values
Mean, Median, and Mode calculation
Date conversion and month-wise analysis
AQI distribution analysis
Data visualization using graphs

Visualizations Included
Histogram of AQI values
Box Plot of AQI
Monthly Average AQI Line Graph
AQI Density Distribution

Conclusion
The analysis shows that Mumbai generally experiences moderate air quality, with occasional high pollution days.
The graphs and statistical analysis help in understanding AQI distribution, seasonal trends, and overall air quality behavior.
