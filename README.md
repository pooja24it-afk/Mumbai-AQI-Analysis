# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis of Mumbai Using Python

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Mumbai using Python.
The objective is to study air pollution patterns through data preprocessing,
statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques.

Dataset
- Source:GitHub
- City: Mumbai
- File Format: CSV
- The dataset contains AQI values along with pollutant information such as PM2.5.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

Techniques Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Mean, Median, and Mode calculation
- Date conversion and monthly analysis
- AQI distribution analysis
- Visualization using multiple graphs

Visualizations Included
- Histogram of AQI values  
- Box Plot of AQI  
- Monthly Average AQI Line Graph  
- AQI Density Distribution (Red Curve)

Conclusion
The analysis indicates that Mumbai generally experiences moderate air quality,
with occasional higher pollution levels. The visualizations help in understanding
the AQI distribution, trends, and seasonal behavior in a clear and
